## Guidelines to use the script:

1) Check the complete EDA of YouTube Data [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ALvee-611/YouTube-Analysis/blob/master/Analysis/EDA.ipynb)
2) Check the code of ML model by using this [script]() 
3) Use the [Dashboard]()

## Summary of EDA process:
The dataset contains 199237 rows and 13 columns, with 109 duplicate entries. 4105 video descriptions are missing and will be replaced with "no description provided." The earliest and latest videos in the dataset were published on 2020-07-27 21:49:32+00:00 and 2023-04-30 16:48:52+00:00, respectively. On average, videos take around 5 days and 16 hours to start trending, with the longest time being 34 days. Most videos are published in the evening. There are 14 video categories, with Entertainment, Gaming, Sports, Music, and People & Blogs being the most popular. Music videos tend to receive more likes, comments, and views than other categories. The NBA youtube channel has the most likes, views, and comments, while BTS (방탄소년단) 'Butter' Official MV was the most liked, viewed, and commented video. Likes, views, and comments have a strong positive correlation with each other. Most videos have 0-30 tags, and videos with 10-25 words in the title receive the most views.
